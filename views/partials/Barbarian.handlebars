<h2> Class Features </h2>

    <h3> Rage </h3>
        <p>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.</p>

        <p>While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
            <li>When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.</li>
            <li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
            <li>If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.</li>
        <ul>
        
        <p>Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then.</p>
        <p>You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>
        
        <p>Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>
        
    <h3> Unarmored Defense </h3>
        <p> While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit. </p>
