<h2> Class Features </h2>

<h3> Divine Sense </h3>
    <p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.</p>
    <p>As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. </p>
    <p>Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover.</p>
    <p>You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity.</p>
    <p>Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.</p>
    
    <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>
    
<h3>Lay on Hands</h3>
    <p>Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest.</p>
    <p>With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level Ã— 5.</p>
    
    <p>As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</p>
    
    <p>Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it.</p>
    <p>You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</p>
    
    <p>This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p>
