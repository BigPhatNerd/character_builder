<h2> Class Features </h2>

<h3>Expertise</h3>
    <p> At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools.</p>
    <p> Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>

    <p> At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.</p>

<h3> Sneak Attack </h3>
    <p> Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll.</p>
    <p> The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>

    <p>You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.<p>

<h3> Thieves' Cant </h3>
    <p> During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation.</p>
    <p> Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p>

    <p> In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p>
