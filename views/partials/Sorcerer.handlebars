<h2> Class Features </h2>

<h3> Spellcasting </h3>
    <p>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.</p>

    <h4> Cantrips </h4>
        <p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</p>
        <p>You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of Table: The Sorcerer.</p>

    <h4>Spell Slots</h4>
        <p>Table: The Sorcerer shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher.</p>
        <p>To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spellâ€™s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>

        <p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.</p>

    <h4> Spells Known </h4>
        <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</p>
        <p>The Spells Known column of Table: The Sorcerer shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice.</p>
        <p>Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>

        <p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>

    <h4> Spell casting ability <h4>
        <p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world.</p>
        <p>You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.</p>
        <p>In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>

        <p>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
    <h4> Spellcasting Focus <h4>
        <p> You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells. </p>
<h3> Sorcerous Origin </h3>
    <p>Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power.</p>

    <p>Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>
